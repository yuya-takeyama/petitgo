# Next Features to Implement

## High Priority

- [ ] Fix ARM64 runtime print function (segfault issue)
- [ ] Improve x86_64 assembly generation
- [ ] Add string literal support in native compilation
- [ ] Implement proper error handling in assembly generation

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add more built-in functions (len, append)
- [ ] Implement struct field access in assembly
- [ ] Add slice operations in native compilation
- [ ] Improve debugging output for assembly

## Low Priority

- [ ] Add Windows support (x86_64)
- [ ] Optimize assembly generation
- [ ] Add inline assembly support
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

This file tracks the next features to implement for petitgo's cross-platform assembly generation.
